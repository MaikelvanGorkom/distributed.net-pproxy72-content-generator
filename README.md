# distributed.net-pproxy72-content-generator
Create a pproxyrc572 with random content.

Welcome to a small script i made for an other script i'm buidling. 
The other script needed an other pproxyrc572 then i had. My own, only had 1 email, 2 OS's and 3 CPU's.

How it works:
Edit the config.php to your needs.
You need to have access to a php command line. 
and then run "php pproxy572_generator.php"
Wait some time and voila, you have a custom pproxy572 file
